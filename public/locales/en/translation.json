	"about__text": "Hi, I'm Elkhan, a Full-Stack developer from Karakol. I recently moved to live in Chicago and I can say it has been an incredible experience for me. My career started in Karakol, where I worked for a small company that developed web applications for local clients. I loved my job, but I always dreamed of more. I knew I needed to move to a bigger city where I could grow professionally and personally. And so, after months of preparation, I moved to Chicago. The first few weeks were difficult: I felt lonely and couldn't make social connections. But I kept working on my projects and attending local mitups and conferences to meet other developers. Finally, I was lucky enough to get a job at a big tech company. I was thrilled with how quickly I was able to fit into the team and start working on big projects. I learned a lot and was able to put my knowledge into practice. Now I feel happy and confident in my future in Chicago. I continue to develop professionally and learn new technologies. I also made new friends and acquaintances in this wonderful city. I look forward to what my future in Chicago will bring. I know that I am on the right track and ready for the new challenges that inevitably await me in the future."
